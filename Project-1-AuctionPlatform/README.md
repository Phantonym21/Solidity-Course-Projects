# Smart Contract for Auction Platform

This project involves creating a smart contract for an auction platform using Solidity, a programming language for creating smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract has several features, including creating an auction with a unique ID, description, start and end time, and minimum bid value, placing bids on active auctions, displaying all bids placed on an auction, displaying all auctions where bids were placed, marking an auction as closed, and other necessary view functions.

## Features

- Create an auction with a unique ID, description, start and end time, and minimum bid value.
- Place bids on active auctions.
- View all bids placed on an auction.
- View all auctions where a bid was placed.
- Mark auctions as closed by selecting a bid and updating the auction status.
- Other necessary view functions for enhanced usability.

## Technologies

- Solidity
- Blockchain Technolog
- Etherium
- Smart Contracts

## Usage

To use this smart contract, you will need an Ethereum wallet and an application that supports interaction with smart contracts.
